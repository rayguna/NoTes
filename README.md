# noT<span style="color: yellow;">e</span>s

## Description
I have trouble remembering things, so I take notes. However, I often forget where I have kept the information I have written down. Therefore, I created a digital notebook called noTes. The letter "e" in <b>noT<span style="color: yellow;">e</span>s</b> is silent, so it is pronounced "noTs," which stands for a number of Ts (or things): "Troves," "Tools," and "Teases." Each of the "Ts" serves a special function in the app, as follows:
- Troves: A collection of your own topics that contains notes.
- Tools: A search tool for navigating through your notes.
- Teases: A collection of collapsible cards created by you to quiz your knowledge.

<b>noT<span style="color: yellow;">e</span>s</b> is intended for habitual note-takers who need access to their notes anytime and anywhere and want to keep their data organized and easy to find.
